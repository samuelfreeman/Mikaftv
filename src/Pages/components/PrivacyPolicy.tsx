                At Mikaf TV, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy
                Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your data while providing broadcasting, entertainment,
                and digital services to our audience.

                Mikaf TV's mission is to deliver quality programming, entertainment, and advertising opportunities to a
                broad audience. We only collect, use, or share your information to enhance your experience and ensure
                seamless communication between viewers, advertisers, and our team. We do not sell your personal
                information to third parties.

                  Mikaf TV's purpose is to enrich lives through technology. We will only collect, use or share your
                  personally identifiable information for that purpose. And we don't sell (as "sell" is traditionally
                  defined) your personally identifiable information to anyone else.

              <p>
                We use the term "personally identifiable information" in these highlights to mean information that
                identifies, or that can reasonably be linked to, an actual natural person (that's a real, named human
                being). We use the stand-alone term "information" to include all types of information, including
                personally identifiable information.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Collection</h2>
              <p>
                We may collect information relevant to you in three ways. First, we may collect information directly from
                you. This could be as part of your interactions with Mikaf TV personnel or when you provide information
                via our digital properties such as websites or mobile apps.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, we will collect such information by observing behavior â€” either in the "real world" or through our
                digital properties like websites and mobile apps.
              </p>
              <p>Finally, we may obtain such information from independent third parties, independent of you.</p>
  
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What we collect:</h3>
              <p>We collect and store information you provide through our digital properties and in our stores.</p>
              <p>The information we collect from you includes things such as:</p>
